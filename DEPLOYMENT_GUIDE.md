## 🔄 Next Steps for Production

### 1. Deploy Solana Program
```bash
# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.16.0/install)"

# Configure for devnet
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
solana-keygen new

# Build and deploy program
cd program
cargo build-bpf
solana program deploy target/deploy/solana_staking_program.so
```

### 2. Update Program ID
- Copy the deployed program ID
- Update `utils/programUtils.ts` with the real program ID
- Replace the placeholder program ID

### 3. Initialize Staking Pool
- Create a script to initialize the staking pool
- Set appropriate reward rates
- Test with small amounts first

### 4. Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred platform
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- ⚠️ This is a **demo application** for educational purposes
- 🔍 Always audit smart contracts before mainnet deployment
- 🧪 Test thoroughly on devnet before production
- 💰 Use small amounts for initial testing
- 🔐 Never share private keys or seed phrases

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Wallet won't connect:**
- Ensure Phantom is installed and unlocked
- Check browser permissions
- Refresh the page

**Airdrop fails:**
- Devnet has rate limits
- Try again after a few minutes
- Check Solana network status

**Build errors:**
- Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check Node.js version (requires v16+)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify wallet connection
3. Ensure you're on Solana devnet
4. Check the README.md for detailed instructions

## 🎯 Demo Video Creation

To create your demo video, show:
1. Wallet connection process
2. SOL airdrop functionality
3. Token purchase
4. Staking tokens
5. Unstaking and claiming rewards
6. UI responsiveness
