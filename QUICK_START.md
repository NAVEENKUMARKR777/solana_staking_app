## ðŸ”§ **How the SSL Error Was Fixed**

### **Problem:**
```bash
curl: (35) OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to release.solana.com:443
```

### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Alternative Download Source**: Used GitHub releases instead of release.solana.com
2. **Manual Installation**: Downloaded and extracted Solana CLI manually
3. **Proper PATH Setup**: Added Solana binaries to system PATH
4. **Configuration**: Set up devnet configuration

### **Commands Used:**
```bash
# Download from GitHub (working alternative)
wget https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/download/v1.16.0/solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2

# Extract and install
tar -xjf solana-release.tar.bz2
cp -r solana-release ~/.local/share/solana/install/active_release

# Add to PATH
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"

# Configure for devnet
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **For Assignment Submission**

### **What You Have:**
1. **âœ… Complete working application**
2. **âœ… All required features implemented**
3. **âœ… Solana devnet integration**
4. **âœ… Phantom wallet support**
5. **âœ… Professional UI/UX**

### **What You Need to Do:**
1. **Create demo video** showing all features
